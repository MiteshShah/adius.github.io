# {{ page.title }}

I'm Adrian Sieber (as you might have figured out by nowâ€¦)
and I'm currently an IT-Systems Engineering bachelor student
at the [Hasso Plattner Institut](https://hpi.de) in Potsdam, Germany.

If you're interested in my work make sure to check out my
[GitHub account](https://github.com/adius) as I publish pretty much
everything there.
My main project at the moment, however, is a website for converting 3D-models
to Lego models.
I work on this with 4 fellow students as a part of our bachelor project.
We will soon publish the website and the source code on GitHub.
(Make sure to follow me on GitHub for updates!)

Apart from that I like to make a lot of music.
My main instrument is the Saxophone.
However, recently I only find time to grab my ukulele now and then and
to strum and sing along to my favorite pop/rock songs.
There are even a view (really old =D)
videos on [youtube](https://youtube.com/LeoMaskMusic).

As sitting in front of the computer the whole day is rather unhealthy
I regularly go jogging and do gymnastics.
In addition I like to go skiing in winter and sailing in summer.
