title: "Germany - You failed the metric system!"

# {{page.title}}

Some of you might watch the TV series "Arrow".
Every time the Arrow catches a criminal who is supposedly harming
his city, he will point it out to them in a theatrical fashion and yell:

> "&lt;name of criminal&gt; - You failed this city!".

I wish we would have someone like him for all the people and organizations
which fail the metric system or standardization in general.

A standardization vigilante who is crusading against those
who refuse to join the golden path of standardization.
Maybe we could call him "Captain ISO". ðŸ˜‚

Joking aside, it's striking how often standards
are ignored or non-standard units are used even in countries
which claim to be metric.

Lately I've become a huge fan of the blog
[themetricmaven.com](http://themetricmaven.com)
in which an US Engineer explores issues arising
from sticking to the "imperial mess of units".

It also made me think of how Germans use units and how the quest of
metrication and standardization has faired here.
I already knew that the US is a huge mess,
but it just dawned on me lately that Germany is only better of
by <del>an inch</del> <ins>a millimeter</ins>.

So let's get started and have a look at all those nasty problem areas.


## Time

While we're far better of with our 24 hours notation then the US
with its PM and AM, in colloquial German we don't always stick to it.

For example if you want to meet up with someone
you could ask  or text them: "Sollen wir uns um 9 Uhr treffen?"
("Shall we meet at 9 o'clock?")

This, however, does not necessarily mean 09:00 h (9 AM).
It can just as well mean 21:00 h (9 PM).

One might argue that the same problem occurs in the US
to a certain degree as well.
The advantage, however, of the US system is that "nine P-M" is even shorter
to say than "nine o-clock".
This leaves little reason to prefer the ambiguous "nine o-clock"
over the shorter and more precise "nine P-M".

In German however it's kind of awkward to say
"um ein-und-zwan-zig Uhr" ("at twentyone o'clock")
and so people often just say "um neun" ("at nine").

(You also can't just say "um ein-und-zwan-zig"
without the "Uhr" at the end,
as nobody would be sure what you are talking about.
For digits from 1 to 12, however, it's perfectly fine to skip the "Uhr"
and everybody still knows that you are talking about a time.)

As you have to infer the correct time from the context -
which is not always possible - this is less than optimal.
It already has (at least in my life) lead to confusion
and misunderstanding a few times.


## Date

The common way to write a date in Germany is DD.MM.YYYY.
The 23. September 2015 e.g. would be 23.09.2015.
This is already better than the absolutely ridiculous US way
of using MM/DD/YYYY, but it still sucks.

The beauty of the standardized YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601) is
that it's sorted from large to small.
That means if you e.g. name you files accordingly they will automatically
be sorted by date as the lexicographical order (alphabetical order)
is the same as the chronological order.
Another good example is skimming of dates in a list.
If you are just interested in the year of a date, you don't have to
read the useless day and month values first.
This is even more obvious when you use the full datetime format.
E.g. 2015-09-23 17:46:23.
It's neatly ordered ascending by magnitude of denoted time
and can be filtered step by step from year over month over day to time.

The funny (or rather sad) thing is that in 1996 the corresponding
DIN standard (the German version of the ISO standard)
declared YYYY-MM-DD the only valid date format in Germany.

This means that all national institutions (educational as well as publc)
were supposed to use exclusively this format.
(I can't remember having learned it at school at all ðŸ˜¡)

However, as the German did not really bother to use the format, they
reintroduced the old way as a valid date format in 2001.

This decision is just absolutely unbelievable to me.
What's next? How about we discontinue some laws or road signs,
because you know: People don't really stick to it.


## Power

One of the most beloved items of the German is of course the car
(or rather "Das Auto") ðŸš™.

Included therein are lengthy discussions of
who has the better and faster one.
And while the times of riding a horse as a means of transportation
are long gone people still mostly use horses to express the
power of their car by stating how much horsepower ("PferdestÃ¤rken")
it has, instead of using the much more suited SI unit "kilowatt".

(And as a side-note it should me mentioned that the US and the UK version
of the horsepower - also called imperial mechanical horsepower -
isn't even the same as the german metric horsepower.
To be exact: 1 metric hp is 0.986 imperial mechanical hp.
*Looking for the head-in-the-sand emoji*)

But to be fair, it seems we are on the right track with this issue.
Since 2010 it's mandatory to specify the power of vehicles in ads
also in kW and manufacturer even seem to prefer kW over PS in ads for
electric vehicles.


## Speed

Talking about cars:
Of course Germans love to go fast on the "Autobahn"
and they measure their speed properly in km/h.
The more of them they measure the better.

However, there is one little problem:
We tend to be a little sloppy with our language.
Germans often say "k m h" instead of
"Kilometer pro Stunde" (kilometer per hour),
which is actually something entirely different,
namely km * h instead of km/h.
You might say that this is half as bad when you just say it,
but mean the correct thing.
This, however, is exactly the problem.
I bet many math and physics teachers can tell you a thing or two about
students not just saying, but also using it the wrong way
and being surprised afterwards that nothing makes any sense.
(Well at least the smarter kids are surprised.
The rest just calculates complete bulls*** without the blink of an eye.)

This is the situation on land.
If we go onto the water, however,
we proverbial throw our metric system over board.

Suddenly we start to measure wind speeds with "Knoten" (knots) or Beaufort,
distances with "Seemeilen" (nautical miles)
and start to use a hand full of other antique units.

How's that again?
We adopted the metric system?
Don't make me laugh!


## Energy

We all need it, we all consume it, we all name it wrong.
Not that is not already bad enough that we still use "Kalorie" (calorie)
although Joule is require by law since 1969.
No, we even use it in the wrong way. Like the US we say "Kalorie",
although we mean "Kilokalorie".
And I feel that it has even gotten worse in recent times.
Previously at least some people said it correctly
and most products were advertised with Kilokalorie.
But nowadays nobody seems to care anymore and e.g. recently I noticed that
exclusively "Kalorie" was used in the descriptions
and the software of my gym's fitness machines.
And all this trouble even though the conversion isn't difficulty.
The kJ (kilojoule) value is approximately 4 times the kcal (kilocalorie) value.
i.e 50 kcal ~= 200 kJ

And even better, it is very imaginative.
1 kJ is approximately the energy needed to lift 100 kg vertically 1 m.
This means if you eat one piece of German chocolate (~370 kJ) you
can lift a quarterback 370 times 1 meter. ðŸ’ª
(Now you also now why eating less is far more important
for loosing weight than exercising)


## Sizes

Worst of all, even the parade discipline of the metric system -
measuring distances - is not spared.
For many fields there exists the convention to use "Zoll" (inch)
as the preferred (or even the mandatory) unit.

Just to name a few items of the endless list of things
you have to buy in inch sizes:

- Displays
- Wheels
- Surfboards
- Many tools
- â€¦

There are also several other specialized units which are derived
from the imperial units:

- Font sizes are measured in point instead of millimeter
- Screen-resolution in dpi (dots per inch) instead of p/mm (pixel per mm)

Lastly we still use imperial units in our language.
You can say:

- "Meilenweit von etwas entfernt sein" (to be miles away from something)
- "Meilenstein" (milestone)
- "Etwas 3 Meilen gegen den Wind riechen" (smell something a mile off)
- "Zollstock" (yardstick)


## Weight

Luckily weight is one category which has completely succeeded
in switching to the metric units â€¦ except for one little stubborn unit.

"Karat" (carat)

This is a particularly nasty one, because it actually means two things
and I don't think many people are aware of it.
In conjunction with gold, carat is an unit to specify the purity of the gold.
In conjunction with diamonds and other gemstones it is an unit of mass.

Seriously? Yes, seriously!
It is the culmination of human idiocy.

Let's make an example:
You want to buy your fiancÃ©(e) a beautiful diamond ring.
The salesman in the jewelry store might show you a particularly lovely one
and explain that it's made from 18 carat yellow gold and is topped with a
2 carat diamond.
What this actually means is that the ring is made from a gold alloy,
which contains 18/24 = 0.75 = 75% pure yellow gold
and that the diamond has a mass of 2 * 0.2 g = 0.4 g.

But I can understand that making transparent statements about the composition
of jewelry is not in the interest of the salesman.
E.g. calling it 12 carat gold sounds much better than admitting that
actually only 50% of it is real gold.

To sum up:
This rant got a little out of hand.
I didn't expect it to get so comprehensive.
Which, however, is a just another evidence of how broken our
*oh so beautiful* system of units is.
But hey, at least it's made in Germany.

The only good thing is that it doesn't have to stay this way.
It's in our hands to change our daily (bad) habits,
to encourage friends to do better
and to urge companies and organizations to use
the internationally recommended units.
