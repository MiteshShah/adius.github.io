Our origin in the cloud,  
hallowed be your IP  
Your history come,  
your will be pulled,  
on localhost, as it is in the cloud,  
Give us this day our daily commit,  
and forgive us our force pushes,  
as we also have forgiven our merge conflicts.  
And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from SVN
